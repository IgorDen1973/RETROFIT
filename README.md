## _Test design mind map_

I created a mind map with the main ideas what and how to test. Here you can find functional test coverage:

### Testing restrictions:

- Functional testing with check for valid & invalid parameters for requests.
- Checking of successful completion for negative scenarios of the operation where invalid value has been accepted.

### Out of coverage:

- Checks across different languages.
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- Cross-platform testing with different resolutions.

### Testing conclusions:

- Properly validation on the client side in the system installed , mainly  detected only for the "id" field as an integer, 
  which does not allow entering other types of data into the mentioned  field. However, the system accepts negative values
  for "id". 
- The largest number of bugs has been detected for the "title" field. There are also disadvantages for the "price" field.
